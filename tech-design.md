# Technical Design Discussion

## Background
During sprint planning meetings, we struggled in reviewing the remaining work on the current sprint and then reviewing, estimating, and assigning tickets that are planned for the up-coming sprint, every time we think we got it, we realize we needed more time to discuss. So, we needed a tool/method to make that more efficient and fast, hence the **Technical Design Discussion** idea was born, some teams call this "story pointing" or "story estimation"; this method worked for us as we did not have the right product staffing like other teams; we improvised and found this method to be helpful and valuable for what we do for the following reasons:
1.	Only engineering team is on these calls as they are pure technical discussions, so there is no point in wasting other people’s time
2.	Allows engineers to decide whether a story/ticket is ready to be discussed in more details, and if not provide feedback to the committee as needed
3.	Gives engineers the opportunity to explore different technical approaches
4.	Allows engineers to review, discuss, challenge each other, and estimate the work
5.	Gives each engineer the opportunity to collaborate by asking questions, sharing their thoughts, challenging presented ideas
6.	Made sprint planning more efficient and fast

## How does it work?
**Note:** If you have a product owner/product manager, this could be easier as they are the ones planning the up-coming sprints and know what tickets need to be done and in which order. In our case, it was a committee reviewing and planning tickets for the up-coming sprint. So, what we did

* Once a week -in our case it was Wednesdays as our sprint planning was Thursdays-, engineering team meets, the meeting is led by a tech lead/senior engineer
* The team reviews tickets top-down, one ticket at a time
* Reviews the notes and ACs for each ticket
* Bounces ideas of how to accomplish the design and implementation
    * If the ticket requires changes/additions to the technical documentations or consumers documentations, we note that
	* If the ticket requires communication to clients/consumers before or after the work, we note that
	* If the ticket requires more research to be done, we note that
* One the team agrees on the design and implementation, the team does the estimation
* It’s important to note that, it’s a time-boxed meeting for one hour
* Since the meeting is iterative, the goal is to finish reviewing and estimating as many tickets as we can in that one hour

In sprint planning meeting, we review any carry overs from the current sprint, and then assign tickets from the up-coming sprint based on the available capacity for each engineer.

If you’re experiencing the same challenges that we had to go through, you may give this method a try!
